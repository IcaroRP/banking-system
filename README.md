# Banking System
A simple banking system made in python as part of the code challenge proposed by DIO potencia tech bootcamp.
In this challenge I made a parody of Maze bank of los santo from GTA V, making the same options present on the bank's website.

In this app the user can do:

 - Deposit (it is not allowed to make a negative deposit)
 - Withdraw (The user can make a withdrawal, but there are some criteria such as: it cannot exceed the balance in the account, the limit as well as the limit of daily withdrawals.)
 - Transaction Log (The user can check all the operations he has done in the application)
